# CM2030_noisyGrid
A project that implements purlin noise to create a generative digital effect.

This is an example of generative artwork. The purlin noise causes the effect to change and fluctuate over time making for an almost living effect.

This was one of four mini projects that amounted to my Midterm submission for CM2030 Graphics Programming

The other projects were:
  
  CM2030_angryBirds
  CM2030_asteroidClone
  CM2030_solarSystem

This project utilizes JavaScript, and the p5.js library to create the graphics effects showcased.
